# web-scrapping
Scrap a data from a online website
For this you need to install some python module ->

   *BeautifulSoup    --  pip3 install beautifulsoup4
   
   *Requests         --   pip3 install requests
   
   *Fake-User agent  -- pip3 install fake-useragent
   
   *os              
   
   *emoji            -- pip3 install emoji
   
   *webbrowser       --  webbrowser is part of the python standard library, you don't have to install a separate package                                 to use it because it comes bundled with your python installation.
